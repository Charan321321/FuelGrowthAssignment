This code Acts as a system which can:
1.Identify unique influencers appearing across these videos
2.Calculate their average performance for each influencer 
3.Help us understand which influencers consistently drive better engagement

I've developed the code using python programming

**Working of the system:**
Initially, the system takes the input as the data and then reads all the video urls and then convert them into the influencers and then retrieve only the unique influenecrs and then calculate the average performance based on the data given in the csv file. In order to provide help with the understanding of the influencers consistency, i have added another column to the output data which is performance consistency whic describes about the influencer consistency. Now all this generated table will be generated in the form of a csv file.
